Description: Efficient methods for constructing confidence intervals of monotone
    graph invariants, as well as testing for monotone graph properties. Many
    packages are available to estimate precision matrices, this package serves as a
    tool to extract structural properties from their induced graphs. By iteratively
    bootstrapping on only the relevant edge set, we are able to obtain the optimal
    interval size.
