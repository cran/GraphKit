Description: Efficient methods for constructing confidence intervals of monotone graph invariants, as well as testing for monotone graph properties. Many packages are available to estimate precision matrices, this package serves as a tool to extract structural properties from their induced graphs. By iteratively bootstrapping on only the relevant edge set, we are able to obtain the optimal interval size.
